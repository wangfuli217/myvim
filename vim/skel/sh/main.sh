#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -eu

# Main bash language cheatsheet.

# The goal is to make this fully executable and automatic self checking,
# but currently it should not be run as it may do bad things:
# copy and paste individual commands of interest on a shell instead.

## Comments

    echo #

  # Escape comment:

    echo \#

  # If a number sign appears in the middle of a string, no need to escape it:

    echo a#b

  # But you should anyways because it is insane. If there is a space, it becomes a comment again:

    echo a #b

## Help

  # Prints help on a built-in commands. The information shown is the same as in the highly recommended:

    #man bash

  # Bash extension.

  # Bash built-in

  # View all built-in commands:

    help

  # Get help on an specific command:

    help help
    help for

## Spaces

  # More than one tabs or spaces are useless like in C.

  # Indentation is not required. Google recommends 2 spaces: Google says 2 spaces: http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/shell.xml?showone=Indentation#Indentation
  # Other styles: <http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/39210/whats-the-standard-for-indentation-in-shell-scripts>

  # `;` can be used to separate commands much like in c:

    echo a; echo b

  # Unlike C, newlines at the end od a command imply `;`:

    echo a
    echo b

  # So you can't use newlines at will as you can in C

    init_test() {
      wd="`pwd`"
      tmp="`mktemp -d`"
      cd $tmp
    }

    cleanup_test() {
      cd "$wd"
      rm -r "$tmp"
    }

# Execute file oustide PATH:

  echo "echo a" > a
  chmod 777 a
  ./a
  #a
  `realpath a`
  #a

## source

## dot

## .

  # Same as copy pasting commands from another file in the current shell.

  # Different from executing the file in a subshell!

  # Some people recommend using extension `.bashrc` for files that are primarily meant to be sourced.

    a=b
    echo 'a=c' > a.bashrc
    . a.bashrc
    [ "$a" = "c" ] || exit 1

  # Bash also supports a `source` operator:

    source a.bashrc

  # However don't use it as it is not POSIX 7.

## Variable substitution

## Parameter expansion

## ${}

  # Replace a variable by its value.

    a='printf b'
    [ $($a) = b ] || exit 1

  # Inside double quotes, variable substitution can happen.

    a=b
    b="$a"
    [ $b = b ] || exit 1

    a=b
    b="${a}c"
    [ $b = bc ] || exit 1

  # Cannot happens inside single quoted strings.

  # Escape:

    a=b
    [ "\$a" = '$a' ] || exit 1

  # Single dollars become literal dolars:

    [ "$" = "\$" ] || exit 1
    [ "$ " = "\$ " ] || exit 1

  # But I woud not rely on such obscure behaviour.

  ## Environment variables

    # It is not possible to set an environment variable for a single command:

      A=a
      [ "$(env A=b echo "$A")" = "a" ] || exit 1
      [ "$A" = "a" ] || exit 1

  ## Expansion

    # Variables are not called variables, but parameter expansion for a reason:
    # they expand at an early stage, and whatever they expand to is evaluated afterwards.

    # This means for instance that you can use variables to store command names and execute them later:

      a="printf"
      [ "$("$a" b)" = "b" ] || exit 1

    # Word splitting however happens before, so the following fails:

      a="printf b"
      [ "$("$a")" = "b" ] || exit 1

    # With:

      #printf b: command not found

    # Because bash is treating "printf b" as a single command.

  ## Parameters are not expand recursivelly

    # Goes for `$`, quotes, etc.

      b=c
      a='$b'
      [ "$a" = '$b' ] || exit 1
      a="$b"
      [ "$a" = c ] || exit 1

    # One possibility is to use eval:
    # http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2005192/how-to-execute-a-bash-command-stored-as-a-string-with-quotes-and-asterisk

  ## Dynamic variable name

  ## Store variable name inside a variable and set it

    # http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16553089/bash-dynamic-variable-names

      a=b
      # Command not found: b=c
      #$a=c

    # `eval` workaround

      b=0
      a=b
      eval "$a=1"
      [ "$b" = 1 ] || exit 1

    ## declare

      # bash extension to set properties of variables.

        b=0
        a=b
        declare $a=1
        [ "$b" = 1 ] || exit 1

  ## Modifiers in parameter expansion

    # String length:

      s='abcd'
      [ ${#s} -eq 4 ] || exit 1

    # Substrings:

      s='abcd'
      [ ${s:0:1} = 'a'  ] || exit 1
      [ ${s:1:1} = 'b'  ] || exit 1
      [ ${s:0:2} = 'ab' ] || exit 1
      [ ${s:2}   = 'cd' ] || exit 1

    # You can do certain glob operations on strings:

      s='12223'

    # Remove shortest matching preffix:

      [ ${s#1*2} = '223' ] || exit 1

    # Uses pattern matching notation to replace.

    # Mnemonic:

    # - `#` (under 3) comes before `%` (under 5) (left of qwerty) so it is the prefix, and not suffix
    # - `##` has more characters than `#`, so it is the longest match possible

    # Remove longest matching preffix

      [ ${s## 1*2} = '3' ] || exit 1

    # Mnemonic: two `## ` is for long, one `#` is for short

    # Remove shortest matching suffix:

      [ ${s%2*3} = '122' ] || exit 1

    # Remove longest matching suffix:

      [ ${s%%2*3} = '1' ] || exit 1

    # Alternate values: <http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_06_02>

    # Check if variable is unset (not null):

      var=''
      [ -z "${var+a}" ] && exit 1
      unset var
      [ -z "${var+a}" ] || exit 1

    ## :-

      # ${a:-b}: expand to `$a` if `a` is neither unset nor null, and expand to `b` otherwise.

    ## :+

      # ${a:+b}: expand to b if a is neither unset nor null. Expand to nothing otherwise:

        x='a'
        [ "${x:+b}" = 'b' ] || exit 1
        unset x
        [ -z "${x:+b}" ] || exit 1

      # Application 1: check if variable is unset or null:

        x='a'
        [ -z "${x:+a}" ] && exit 1
        x=''
        [ -z "${x:+a}" ] || exit 1
        unset x
        [ -z "${x:+a}" ] || exit 1

      # Application 1: only add path separator if the prefix is not null:

        pref='a'
        path="${pref}${pref:+/}b"

      # This allows relative paths

    # Important distinction when running with `-u`, where `[ -z "$VAR" ]` would give an error.
    # This often bytes when running scripts that use `PS1` to check if running interactively with `[ -z "$PS1" ]`,
    # when you want to source them from a non interactive script like a Vagrant provision script.

    ## Applications

      # Get file extension or path without the extension:

        s='a/b.ext'
        [ ${s%.*}  = 'a/b' ] || exit 1
        [ ${s##*.} = 'ext' ] || exit 1

  ## unset

      a=''
      unset a
      [ -z "${a+a}" ] || exit 1

  ## readonly

    # POSIX 7:
    # <http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_23>

      readon=b
      readonly readon
      #readon=c
      #error: readon is readonly

    # TODO how to undo readonly?

  ## Null character

    # It seems that variables cannot contain nul characters in POSIX: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6570531/assign-string-containing-null-character-0-to-a-variable-in-bash

      printf 'a\0b' | od -tx1
      A="$(printf "a\0b")"
      printf "$A" | od -tx1

    # Outputs:

      #0000003

      #0000000 61 62
      #0000002

    # Bash has the `$""` extension that works for literals.

  ## Special variables

    # Some variables:

    # - are automatically set by bash to special values in addition to those inherited from parent
    # - control the behaviour of bash such as GLOBIGNORE

    # Some are readonly, others read write.

    # Commented list : <http://wikibash-hackers.org/syntax/shellvars>
    # also see man bash / shell variables.

    ## Paths related to current script

      # <http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/4650/determining-path-to-sourced-shell-script>

      # See the relpath.sh scripts in current directory for some tests.

      ## $0

        # Relative path to the current executed script:

          printf '#!/bin/bash\necho "$0"\n' > a
          chmod +x a
          ./a

        # When on a login shell, it is set to `-bash`.

      ## BASH_SOURCE

        # Vs `$0`: `BASH_SOURCE` is also modified when a script is sourced,
        # so it can also find the path of the sourced script.

        # Get the full path of currently executing script:
        # http://stackoverflow.com/questions/59895/can-a-bash-script-tell-what-directory-its-stored-in

          DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

        # Force script to run from current directory no matter where it was called from:

          #cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")"

      ## $_

        # Last word of last command.

          :
          [ "$_" = ':' ] || exit 1

          [ "$_" = 'b' ] || exit 1
          true
          [ "$_" = 'true' ] || exit 1

        # Before any other command, it is the first argument of invocation.

        # Vs `$0`: `$_` follows the exact way the script was invoqued:
        # it will give different results if you do `bash script.sh` and `./script.sh`:
        # `/bin/bash` and `./scrit.sh` respectively.
        # `$0` always gives `./script.sh` for both.

## Parenthesis

## ()

## Command groups

  # Formal name: command group..

  # What is inside runs inside what Bash and POSIX call a "subshell environment".

  # This may or may not generate a `fork` system call, but is distinct from an actual bash subprocess,
  # e.g. bash -c 'command'.

  # - http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/138463/do-parentheses-really-put-the-command-in-a-subshell
  # - http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_12

  # Basically, the command group is a clone of the parent,
  # but anything done to it like setting variables is not visible from the parent.

  # The only things you can get out of it are exit status and stdout.

  ## Command group PID

    # Unchanged.

      [ "$$" = "$( (echo "$$") )" ] || exit 1

  ## Command group and directory

    # Change current dir, prints previous dir:

      cd; pwd

    # Does not change current dir and prints home dir:

      ( cd; pwd )

## Subshell

  # Good source: <http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/advanced_bash_scripting_guide/subshells.html>

  ## Create subshells

    # Operations that create subshells:

    # Command groups:

        ( echo a )

    # Commands inside braces do not generate subshells.

    # Both sides of pipes run on subshells:
    # there is not alternative since a pipe must be created between two processes.

      a=0
      echo a | a=1
      [ $a = 0 ] || exit 1

      a=0
      a=1 | echo
      [ $a = 0 ] || exit 1

    # For and while do *not* create a subshell:

      a=0
      for i in 0 1; do
        a=$i
      done
      [ $a = 1 ] || exit 1

      a=0
      while read l; do
        a=$l
      done < <( printf "0\n1\n" )
      [ $a = 1 ] || exit 1

  ## Properties of subshells

    # Unexported variables carry over:

      a=0
      [ "$( ( echo "$a" ) )" = 0 ] || exit 1

    # Assignments do not affect parent:

      a=0
      ( a=1 )
      [ "$a" = 0 ] || exit 1

    # Directory changes do not affect parent:

      cd
      ( cd .. )
      [ "$(pwd)" = "$HOME" ] || exit 1

    # Subshell output can be piped:

      [ "$( ( printf a; printf b ) | cat )" = 'ab' ] || exit 1

    # Subshell input for the first command can come from a pipe:

      [ "$( echo a | ( cat; cat ) )" = 'a' ] || exit 1

    # PID may TODO must? be the same as parent?
    # But subshells are forks, no?

      [ "$(echo $$)" = "$( ( echo $$ ) )" ] || exit 1

  ## Nested shells

    # A subshell is different from a shell launched inside a shell.

    ## export

      # POSIX 7:
      # <http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_22>

      # Subshells inherit variables from parent even it they were not exported:

        a=0
        [ "$( ( echo "$a" ) )" = 0 ] || exit 1

      # But a shell inside a shell does not unless they are exported:

        a=0
        bash -c '[ -z "$a" ]' || exit 1

        export a=0
        bash -c '[ ! -z "$a" ]' || exit 1

      # It does not seem possible to undo an export: only to unset the variable.

      # Functions can only be exported as a bash extension.

        f() { echo a; }
        export -f f
        [ "$(bash -c 'f')" = "a" ] || exit 1

      # Seems not possible in POSIX: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1885871/exporting-a-function-in-shell

      # With the `-p` argument, gives a list of exported variables,
      # but bash seems to not follow POSIX and use the same format as it uses for `export` (no arguments),
      # which is unspecified. So use use the `export` extension if you really need to
      # while we wait for bash to comply.

      # Sample output:

        #declare -x rvm_user_flag
        #declare -x rvm_version="1.25.31 (stable)"
        #declare -x rvm_wrapper_name

      # `declare` is a bash extension command that sets properties of variables,
      # amongst them exportedness.

    ## declare +x

      # Unexport:

        export a=0
        declare +x a
        bash -c '[ -z "$a" ]' || exit 1

## Braces

## {}

## Inline group

  # Formal name: inline group.

  # Excutes in current context.

    a=0
    b=1
    { printf $a; printf $b; } | cat

  # Prints `01`.

  # Does not spawn a subshell.

## Command substitution

  # <http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html>

  ## ``

  ## Backtick

    # Same as <#eval expression>

      [ `echo a` = a ] || exit 1

    # External double quote not assumed.

      [ ! `echo "a b"` = "a b" ] || exit 1
      [ "`echo "a b"`" = "a b" ] || exit 1

    # Inner double or single quotes are fine:

      [ "`echo "a b"`" = "a b" ] || exit 1
      [ "`echo 'a b'`" = "a b" ] || exit 1

    # Inner backquotes don't work:

      #`echo `echo a``

    # This is why `$()` is better: you can nest it because it has an open/close pair:

      #$( echo $( echo a ))

    # Therfore consider always using `$()`.

  ## $()

    # Similar to backquote:

      [ "$(echo abc)" = "abc" ] || exit 1
      [ "`echo abc`" = "abc" ] || exit 1

    # Better than backquote because it can be nested:

      [ "$(echo $(echo a))" = "a" ] || exit 1

    # Always use `$()` instead of backquotes.

  ## Trailing newlines

    # Trailing newlines **are removed** after command substition.

      [ "$(printf "a\n\n")" = "a" ] || exit 1

    # Methods to overcome it.

    ## Add dummy char and remove it later:

      # Best POSIX option.

        S="$(printf "a\n\n"; printf "a")"
        [ "$(printf "${S%a}" | wc -c)" = "3" ] || exit 1

    # When reading from a file, Bash extension mapfile:

      TMP_FILE="$(mktemp)"
      printf "a\n\n" > "$TMP_FILE"
      mapfile <"$TMP_FILE" S
      # TODO why fails?:
      #[ "$(printf "${S}" | wc -c)" = "3" ] || exit 1
      rm "$TMP_FILE"

## Process substitution

## <()

  # bash extension.

  # Expands a line of the type `<(echo a)` to either a FIFO or a `/dev/fd`,
  # open file descriptor that contains whatever was echoed.

  # Typical application: pass variables as file contents to utilities
  # that expect files.

    echo 'Process substitution:'
    A='file content'
    echo <(echo "$A")
      # Possible output:
      #/dev/fd/63
    [ "$(cat < <(echo "$A"))" = "$A" ] || exit 1

## Expansion

  # Lots of basic bash functionality is done through expansion:
  # e.g., variables are direclty replaced by their values before the command is evaluated.

  # This allows you to to weird stuff with variables in bash which you couldn't do in other languages,
  # and greatly increases the insanity of Bash.

  ## Pathname expansion

  ## Globbing

    # Formal name: #<pathname expansion>

    # Bash expands certain sequences to filenames before issuing commands.

    # Nonhidden files cur dir (if there is at least one non-hidden file):

      echo *

    # Expansion only happens if there is at least one match.
    # If not, the original sequence is used.

      mkdir empty
      cd empty
      [ `printf *` = '*' ] || exit 1

    # Hidden in files cur dir. Includes the annoying `.` and `..`:

      echo .*

    ## List all files in cur dir except `.` and `..`

      # - <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2910049/how-to-use-the-wildcard-in-bash-but-exclude-the-parent-directory>
      # - <http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/1168/how-to-glob-every-hidden-file-except-current-and-parent-directory>

      # The problem is that `.*` includes `.` and `..`, and `..?*` becomes literal if no files match it.

      # I am yet to find a satisfactory POSIX commpliant way to do this.

      ## GLOBIGNORE

        # The best bash extension way without subshell is:

          GLOBIGNORE_OLD="$GLOBIGNORE"
          GLOBIGNORE=".:.."
          echo .*
          GLOBIGNORE="$GLOBIGNORE_OLD"

        # The following *does not work* TODO why:

          env GLOBIGNORE=".:.." echo *

        # With subshell:

          (GLOBIGNORE=".:.."; echo .*)

        # The following *does not work* TODO why:

          env GLOBIGNORE=".:.." bash -c 'echo .*'

      ## dotglob

        # Works for this case, but only if we also want the non hidden files.

        # Harder to properly restore state than `GLOBIGNORE`:

          OPT="nullglob"
          shopt -u | grep -q "$OPT" && changed=true && shopt -s "$OPT"
          echo *
          [ $changed ] && shopt -u "$OPT"; unset changed

      ## nullglob

        # Harder to properly restore state than `GLOBIGNORE` and longer than dotglob, so not useful:

          OPT="nullglob"
          shopt -u | grep -q "$OPT" && changed=true && shopt -s "$OPT"
          echo * .[^.]* ..?*
          [ $changed ] && shopt -u "$OPT"; unset changed

        # nullglob is required because ..?* expands to a literal otherwise.

      # - `ls -A` is good to view, but not usable programmatically if filenames have spaces.

    # Escape:

      echo '*'
      echo "*"

    # Start with a:

      echo a*

    # Second letter a:

      echo ?a*

    # * matches "".

    # Start with a or b:

      echo [ab]*

    # Start with 0, 1 or 2.

      echo [0-2]*

    # Works with vars:

      a=b
      "$a"*

    # Shows all the files that start with b

    ## Combos

      # For loop in cur dir:

        for f in .* *; do echo "$f"; done

    ## Extended globbing

      # Glob with ERE-like expressions instead of BREs

      # Activate:

        shopt -s extglob

      # Behavior:

          # glob             ERE mnemonic
          # ?(pattern-list)  (...|...)?
          # *(pattern-list)  (...|...)*
          # +(pattern-list)  (...|...)+
          # @(pattern-list)  (...|...)  [@ not a RE syntax]
          # !(pattern-list)  "!" used as for negative assertions in RE syntax

      # Note that `|` can only be used if the parenthesis are preceeded by a special char.

      # Works:

          # .@(js|coffee)

      # Fails:

          # .@(js|coffee)

      # Parenthesis are mandatory.

      # Examples:

      # All files except two:

        #echo !(a|b)

      # All files inside directory except two:

        #echo d/!(a|b)

      # If you are going to copy things, use `rsync --exclude a --exclude b`.

  ## Tilde expansion

      [ "`sudo -u a echo ~`" = /home/a ] || exit 1
      [ "`echo ~a`" = /home/a ] || exit 1
      [ "`echo ~root`" = /root ] || exit 1

## test

  # Compare values and check files, answer on exit status.

  # Bash implements it as a built-in, and Ubuntu also has `/usr/bin/test`:

    which test

  ## No command line options

    # Without any flags or special operators like `=`,
    # `test` simply checks if an argument was given.

      test && exit 1
      test true || exit 1

    # Expressions don't get evaluated at all.

    # When part of the `test` statement, `!` does not force command evaluation:
    # it simply negates what would happen if it were not there!

      [ ! false ] && exit 1

    ## r

      # File or directory exists and has read permission.

      # Useful in conjunction with `-f` before taking input from a file,
      # since just checking its exsitence is not enough to read from it.

    ## e

      #file exists

    ## s

      #exists and has size > 0

        rm -rf a

  ## Infinite loops

    # It is hard to escape infinite loops in bash via Ctrl-C because commands are executed in subshells.
    # and the subshell gets the SIGTERM instead of the one with the while loop.

    # http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/42287/terminating-an-infinite-loop

    # Best solution to stop an interactive infinite loop:

      bash -c 'while true; do sleep 60; done' &

    # And then `kill %1`.

    # If you don't use `bash -c`, Ctrl + Z will work.

  ## While from stdin

    # While can take stdin, and forwards it to the command it runs:

      [ "$(echo a | while cat; do break; done)" = "a" ] || exit 1
    # From file:
      echo a > file
      [ "$(while cat; do break; done <file)" = "a" ] || exit 1
    # With proces substitution Bash extension:
      [ "$(while cat; do break; done <(echo a))" = "a" ] || exit 1
    # This leads to the classic POSIX read loop stdin linewise combo:
      printf "a\nb\n" | while read LINE; do
        echo "$LINE"
      done
    # You ofen see the Bash only command substitution version which
    # you should never use because the POSIX one even golfs better:
      while read LINE; do
        echo "$LINE"
      done < <(printf "a\nb\n")
## File descriptors
## Redirection
  # The following descriptors are always open by default:
  # - 0: stdin
  # - 1: stdout
  # - 2: stderr
  # Echo to stderr:
    echo 'to stderr' 1>&2
  # Descriptor 3 to descriptor 4:
    echo a 3>&4
  # Descriptor 3 to file f:
    echo a 3>f
  # If input descrpitor is not given it defaults 1 (stdout). Decriptor 1 to file f:
    echo a >f
  # Redirect both stdout and stderr to file:
    echo a &>f
  # Bash extension, not present in `sh`, so only in scripts only use:
    echo a >f 2>&1
  # Same as above but desincouraged by the manual since it breaks if file name is a number:
    echo a >&f
  # Append stdout to file:
    echo a >>"$f"
    outerr() {
      echo 'out'
      echo 'err' 1>&2
    }
    outerr
    #out
    #err
    outerr &>/dev/null
    #
    outerr >/dev/null
    #err
    outerr 2>/dev/null
    #out
  ## Multiple redirections
    # The order of multiple redirections matters.
    # Think of them as variable assignments made from right to left.
      outerr >/dev/null 2>&1
      #
      outerr 2>&1 >/dev/null
      #err
  ## Stdin redirection
    # Analogous to stdout redirection.
    # Get stdin of previous command from given file.
      printf abc >f
      [ $(cat <f) = abc ] || exit 1
    # Combo combo with Process Substitution to pass a variable to stdin:
      [ $(cat < <(printf abc)) = abc ] || exit 1
  ## | ## pipe
    # `a | b` connects stdout and stderr of `a` to stdin of `b`.
      [ "`outerr | cat`" = $'out\nerr' ] || exit 1
    # Make a pipe take only stderr:
      outerr |& cat
      outerr >/dev/null | cat
  ## Create file descriptors
    # It is possible to create further file descriptors.
    # First, those descriptors must be made point somewhere,
    # or you get a `bad file descriptor error`:
      #echo a 1>&13
    # The usual way to use them is to redirect them to existing files or other
    # descriptors via the exec redirection combo.
    # From now on, redirect `3` to `1`:
      exec 3<&1
    # Echo to 3:
      echo 3 >&3
    # Close 3
      exec 3>&-
    # Before you close the file, a file descriptor will be pointing to it:
      #$ exec 3<> /tmp/foo
      #$ lsof /tmp/foo
      #COMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF    NODE NAME
      #bash    22924 ciro    3u   REG    8,8        0 1713824 /tmp/foo
      #$ exec 3>&-
      #$ lsof /tmp/foo
    # Open file `f` and assign fd 3 to it:
      exec 3<>f
    # Read the first line
      read <&3
    # Close `3`:
      exec 3>&-
    # TODO why is exec needed?
  ## Modify in-place gotcha
    #YOU CANNOT MODIFY A FILE INLINE WITH REDIRECTION LIKE THIS:
      echo $'0\n1' > a
      grep 0 a | cat > a
    #this simply erases a
    #reason:
    #workaround: use sponge from moreutils.

    ## alias vs function vs script
      # Aliases are strictly less versatile than functions TODO check because:
      # - cannot take arguments like `$1`, to use them inside the command or multiple times as in:
          f() { echo "$1"; echo "$1"; }
      # - cannot be exported to subshells like functions via `export -f` (bash extension to POSIX).
      # External scripts have the advantages that:
      # - they can be called by external programs outside bash sessions
      # - they are not loaded in memory, so they don't take memory space
      # The downside of scripts is that since they are not loaded in memory, they may take more time to load.
    ## Find what an alias maps to
      # Use `type`.
    ## Expand alias to the actual command.

      # For example, it is the same to do:
        #bash -e a.sh
      # and to add:

          set -eu
      ## v
        # Print every string read by the shell before it is executed.
        # Everything is printed out, including comments.
        # Useful for debugging.
        # For exapmle:

          # comment
          echo $a
          set +v
        # Outputs:

          a=b
      ## x
        # Print every string before it is executed with all expansions done.
        # Useful for debugging.
        # For example:
          a=b
          set -x
          echo $a
          set +x
        # Outputs:

  ## shopt
    # Controls boolean options that determine how the shell behaves.
    # shopt vs set: <http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/32409/set-and-shopt-why-two>
    # shopt is not POSIX, so it only contains bash extensions.
    # Show all options:
      shopt
    # Show one option:
      shopt dotglob
    # Set option:
      shopt -s op
    # Unset option:
      shopt -u op
    # Store shopt state for a single command: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9126060/is-there-an-easy-way-to-set-nullglob-for-one-glob

      shopt -u | grep -q "$OPT" && changed=true && shopt -s "$OPT"
      echo ..*
      [ "$changed" ] && shopt -u "$OPT"; unset changed
    ## invocation
      # All shopt options can be set from the command line invocation with `[-+]O <opt>`
      # For example:
        bash -O dotglob a.sh
      # Is the same as adding:
        shopt -s dotglob
      # to `a.sh`, and:
        bash +O dotglob a.sh
      # is the same as adding:
        shopt -u dotglob a.sh
## tab expansion
  # Bash in interactive mode uses tab for command completion.
  # `sh` does not implement this, so this is not required by POSIX.
  # For example, if you type:
    #ec
  # and then hit `<tab>`, you will get a list like:
    #echo   eclipse  econvert
  # If there is only one possible command, it expands automatically.
  # To avoid this and insert a literal tab, do `<c-v><tab>`, in analogy to the other
  # escape characters input.
## exec
  # POSIX 7.
  # Interface similar to an exec system call: ends current shell and runs given command instead
  # Destroys the calling bash!
    [ $SHLVL = 1 ] || exit 1

    # Open "echo a" in the editor determined by the FCEDIT environment variable,
    # and when you quit, executes what you wrote:
      echo a
      fc
    # List latest commands:
      fc -l
    # Sample output:
      # 301     command1
      # 302     command2
      # 303     command2
      # ...
    # List without line numbers (but still with heading spaces.
      fc -nl
    # Print the last command with extra heading spaces:
      fc -ln -1

  ## History expansion ## ! ## exclamation mark #history substitution
    # Expands to the last command that starts with string.
    # Also expands inside double quotes! but not inside single quotes.
    # Controlled by the `H` option. Turned on by default on interactive shells.
      set -H
      echo a
      !e
      # Shell shows:
      # echo a
      # Output:
      # a
      [ "!e" = "echo a" ] || exit 1
    # The substitution happens early and insanely: it even affects what will go into history.
      echo a
      echo !e
      #echo echo a

## clear
  # Clear terminal screen
      clear
## dirs
  # Move between dirs in stack.
  # Builtins, not in `sh`.
  # Show dir stack:
    dirs
  # -v : verbose. one per line, with line numbers:
    dirs -v
  # Push to dir stack
    pushd .
  # Pop from dir stack and cd to it
    popd
  # Very useful in when you need to cd somewherelse and come back later:
    pushd .
      cd d
      pwd
      pushd .
        cd d2

## eval
  # POSIX 7.
  # Exec string in current bash
    eval "a=b"
    [ $a = b ] || exit 1
  # Concatenates arguments, space separated:
    [ `eval echo a` = a ] || exit 1
  ## Applications
    # Make varname from var>
      a=b
      eval "$a=c"
      [ $b = c ] || exit 1
