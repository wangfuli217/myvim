**git-extra-commands** is a ZSH plugin that packages some extra `git` helper scripts I've found. This collection (and the scripts that I wrote in it) is licensed with the Apache Version 2 license.

This collection doesn't actually require ZSH, but packaging it as a ZSH plugin makes it more convenient for people using a ZSH framework to use this collection.

However, some of the scripts in this collection came from other sources and may have different licensing - if they do, their license information is included inline in the script source.

If you wrote one of these scripts and want it removed from this collection, please either make a PR and/or file an issue against the repository and I will remove it.

## Useful git aliases

Here are some helpful aliases for your `~/.gitconfig`

| alias | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `ahead-of-master = log --oneline origin/master..HEAD` | Show commits that haven't made it to master yet. |
| `fetch-pull-requests = fetch origin '+refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pull/*'` | Fetch pull requests from GitHub so you can `git checkout pull/123` and test them locally. |
| `roots = log --all --oneline --decorate --max-parents=0` | Show the root commits. |
| `unpushed = log @{u}..` | Show which commits have not been pushed to the tracking branch and are safe to amend/rebase. |
| `work-in-progress = rebase -i @{u}` | Starts an interactive rebase of all the commits you haven't pushed yet. Handy for collapsing a bunch of work-in-progress snapshots into logical commits before pushing, without having to worry about accidentally squashing a commit someone else has already referred to. |

## Installing

### Pre-requisites

- A relatively recent version of `git`. The version of `git` Apple includes in macOS is very stale. You should really `brew install git` to get the current version if you're on macOS - if not for features, for security updates.
- Python 3+
- Ruby 2.2+

### Zgenom

If you're using [Zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom):

1. Add `zgenom load unixorn/git-extra-commands` to your `.zshrc` along with your other `zgenom load` commands.
2. `zgenom reset && zgenom save`

### Antigen

If you're using [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen):

1. Add `antigen bundle unixorn/git-extra-commands@main` to your `.zshrc` where you've listed your other plugins.
2. Close and reopen your Terminal/iTerm window to **refresh context** and use the plugin. Alternatively, you can run `antigen bundle unixorn/git-extra-commands` in a running shell to have `antigen` load the new plugin.

### oh-my-zsh

If you're using [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh):

1. Clone the repository into a new `git-extra-commands` directory in oh-my-zsh's plugin folder:

  `git clone https://github.com/unixorn/git-extra-commands.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/git-extra-commands`

2. Edit your `~/.zshrc` and add `git-extra-commands` – same as clone directory – to the list of plugins to enable:

  `plugins=( ... git-extra-commands )`

3. Then, restart your terminal application to **refresh context** and use the plugin. Alternatively, you can source your current shell configuration:

  `source ~/.zshrc`

### Bash / Manual Installation

Nothing here actually requires you to use ZSH or zgen, that's just a convenient distribution method for anyone using a ZSH framework.

If you aren't using any ZSH frameworks, or if you're using `bash`, `fish` or another shell, do the following steps:

1. `git clone` this repository
2. Add `cloneDirectory/bin` to your `$PATH` in your shell's startup file.

## Miscellaneous Tips

### Make it easier to check out default branch

Many repositories are switching away from using **master** as the default branch name. You can do `git config --global alias.co-default '!'"git checkout \$(git branch -r | awk -F/ '/HEAD/ {print \$NF}')"` to add a co-default alias that will determine what the repository's default branch is for you.

Alternatively, add the following aliases from a tweet by [@jnesselr](https://twitter.com/jnesselr) to your `.gitconfig` file:

```sh
cdef = "!git checkout $(git originhead)"
originhead = "!git remote show origin | grep 'HEAD branch' | cut -d ' ' -f5"
```

This queries the remote to get the current up to date default branch, so it will work even if the remote's default branch changes after you did your initial checkout.

### Have git cope with typos

Do `git config --global help.autocorrect 1`

git will now try to figure out what you meant, for example:

```sh
$ git commt
WARNING: You called a Git command named 'commt', which does not exist.
Continuing in 0.1 seconds, assuming that you meant 'commit'.
```

### Rewrite `git://` with `https://`

```sh
git config --global url."https://github".insteadOf git://github
```

### or replace with `ssh`

 Use `ssh` instead of `https://`

 ```sh
 git config --global url."git@github.com:".insteadOf "https://github.com/"
 ```

## Contributing

- Please include an entry both in the credits section of README.md for any scripts and a credit comment in the script itself in your PRs so authors get their work credited correctly.
- Please use `#!/usr/bin/env interpreter` instead of a direct path to the interpreter, this makes it easier for people to use more recent versions when the ones packaged with their OS (macOS and CentOS, I'm looking at you!) are stale.
